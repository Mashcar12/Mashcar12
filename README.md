Work in progress.

My plan is to make collection of everything you can mod your 8570w to make it better and last longer.

List of TODO:

-Upgrade GPU
-Upgrade CPU
-Modify and upgrade cooling system
-Upgrade WiFi and Bluetooth
-Add additional SATA3 SSD and NVME drive
-Upgrade fingerprint scanner
-Upgrade LCD to 16:10 
-Modify screen cable (no need to buy rare DC2 assembly)
-Undervolt CPU and GPU
-Overclock RAM 
-Upgrade built in audio
-Hardware disable for WWAN slot
-Motherboard patches
-Addditional USB 3.0 ports
-Guides for all above and other things like - how to install driver for upgraded GPU, important BIOS options, how to flash vBIOS, where to look for answers, etc.

Less important and harder to do:
-UEFI module hacking or installing coreboot

I already did many of those, only few to go. And step-by-step documentation so anyone can do it, here on github.
You may find me on notebooktalk, 4pda, ibmnb or hpfocus forums.
